This file contains details about the maintanance task which occurs in the
development process of Breakout.

Building a new release
----------------------
If you make changes in the core of Breakout, a new build is needed to test the
features. In the 'build' directory are scripts for different operating system
available to ease this task.

Windows: build.bat
Linux:   build.sh

Or you can call the build script manually:

$ python build.py [Release Number]

Updating the documentation
--------------------------
Documentation is generated as part of the build process. The documentation uses 
JsDoc Toolkit (http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/).

Running tests
-------------
Tests (in Breakout/test/) are run automatically at the end of the build process.
[phantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and [mocha-phantomjs](https://github.com/metaskills/mocha-phantomjs) are required to run tests via the build script.
See the README file in Breakout/test/ for more info on running the tests.

Cleaning-up
-----------
Too much temp files in your directories, get rid of them.

$ find . -type f -name "*~" -print0 | xargs -0 rm

Updating to another jQuery release
----------------------------------
Whenever a switch to a new jQuery release happens, all example files need an
update. This should happen after the jQuery files under 'libs' in the example 
directory are updated.

Change the working directory to 'examples', tweak the command below, and
execute it. Using only the release number is possible but not recommended.

$ find . -type f -name "*.html" | xargs sed -ie 's|jquery-1.8.3|jquery-1.9.0|g'

To remove temp files (htmle) generated by above process:

$ find . -type f -name "*.htmle" -exec rm -f {} \;

Don't forget to commit all example files to the dev branch of your Breakout
fork and open a pull request on Github.

Updating to another jQuery UI release
-------------------------------------
This is performed the same way as a jQuery update. To avoid issues it's 
recommended to use the name and the release.

$ find . -type f -name "*.html" | xargs sed -ie 's|jquery-ui-1.9.0|jquery-ui-1.10.0|g'
