        <h1>Using the Pin Object</h1>
        <small class="post-meta"></small>
        <p>Each analog and digital pin of the I/O board is represented by a <a title="pin"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.Pin.html">Pin</a> object. The Pin object is the foundation for
          many of the Breakout IO objects and is also very useful on it&#8217;s own. This section describes how to use
          pins as <a href="#digital_input">digital inputs</a>,<a href="#digital_output"> digital outputs</a>, <a
            href="#analog_input">analog inputs</a> and <a href="#analog_output">analog outputs</a>.</p>
        <p><a name="digital_input"></a></p>
        <h2>Digital Input</h2>
        <p>Let&#8217;s assume you have an Arduino board with a button connected to digital pin 2 and that you have
          created an instance of the IOBoard object and named it &#8220;board&#8221;.</p>
        <p>In order to use pin 2 as an input, you must first set the pin mode to digital input (DIN):</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.setDigitalPinMode(2, Pin.DIN);</code></div>
        <p>Next you need to get a reference to the Pin object associated with digital pin 2:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var btn = board.getDigitalPin(2);</code></div>
        <p>So in order to use a digital pin as an input, you first need to set the pin mode, then get a reference to the
          pin:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.setDigitalPinMode(2, Pin.DIN);<br />
  var btn = board.getDigitalPin(2);<br />
  </code></div>
        <p>Now that we have a reference to the pin we can we can read the pin&#8217;s value:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var pinValue = btn.value;</code></div>
        <p>The value of a digital input will be 1 or 0. While we can check the pin value at any time, it&#8217;s most
          useful get the value only when it changes. To do this, you can attach an event listener to the Pin object. In
          this example we&#8217;ll listen for a change event:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>btn.addEventListener(PinEvent.CHANGE, onPinChange);</code></div>
        <p>This will call the listener function <code>onPinChange</code> each time the value of the pin changes. You can
          use any name you like for the listener (so onPin2Change, onBtnChange, etc. are also valid names).</p>
        <p>Next we define the listener function:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function onPinChange(event) {
    console.log("pin value = " + event.target.value);
  }</pre>
        <p>Notice the function parameter named <code>event</code>. This is an object that contains data about the event
          (in this case a <a title="PinEvent" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.PinEvent.html">PinEvent</a>).
          You can use any name for this parameter (&#8216;evt&#8217; and &#8216;e&#8217; are other common names). All
          event objects have a property named <code>target</code> that provides a reference to the object that fired the
          event. So in this case, <code>event.target</code> refers to the Pin object representing the button and
          therefore <code>event.target.value</code> refers to the value of the button (either 1 or 0). The code simply
          prints the pin value to the console each time the button is pressed.</p>
        <p>If you need to refer to the target more than once, it is best to create a variable first such as:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var pin = event.target;<br />
  console.log("pin value = " + pin.value);<br />
  </code></div>
        <p>This is more clear and also makes lookups to properties of pin faster if you need to get or set the value of
          multiple properties.</p>
        <p>We can also get the <code>number</code> of the pin. This is useful if you have more than one digital input
          and want to use a single listener to handle all of the inputs. For example, assume you have also connected
          buttons to pins 3 and 4 of the I/O board and added a listener for the CHANGE event to each Pin object. You can
          handle all of the changes in a single listener function to save memory:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function onPinChange(event) {
    var pin = event.target;
    switch(pin.number) {
      case 2:
        doSomething(pin.value);
        break;
      case 3:
        doSomethingElse(pin.value);
        break;
      case 4:
        doAnotherThing(pin.value);
        break;
    }
  }</pre>
        <p>There are two additional events available for the Pin object. They are PinEvent.FALLING_EDGE and
          PinEvent.RISING_EDGE. The falling edge event is dispatched / fired when the pin changed value from 1 to 0. The
          rising edge event is fired when the pin changed value from 0 to 1. If you are only interested in being
          notified when the value changes from 0 to 1, then simply listen for the rising edge event:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">btn.addEventListener(PinEvent.RISING_EDGE, onHigh);
  
  function onHigh(event) {
    // assume the button is wired with a pull-down resistor so a value
    // of 1 indicates that the button was pressed
    console.log("button pressed");
  }</pre>
        <p>Now that you have a better understanding of how to use a pin as a digital input, you may be wondering what
          the difference is between using a Pin object as a digital input and using the Breakout <a
            title="Button documentation" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.Button.html">Button</a> object.
          The Button object is a wrapper around a digital input pin, but it provides a number of useful features such as
          switch <a title="switch debounce"
            href="http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/electronics/debounce.html">debouncing</a>, sustained press events (fires
          at the interval specified while the button is held continuously) and setting the pin mode automatically. In
          most cases, if you are using an actual button (in that it&#8217;s a digital input that is physically pressed
          by a human) as a digital input it is best to use the Button object, but if you have another type of digital
          input that is not controlled by a physical press (such as a motion sensor that outputs a high or low value
          when presence is detected), then it may make more sense to use the Pin directly as described in this section.
        </p>
        <p>Now lets look at digital output.</p>
        <p><a name="digital_output"></a></p>
        <h2>Digital Output</h2>
        <p>A common digital output that is easy to understand is an LED. Let&#8217;s assume an LED is connected to
          digital pin 9 of an Arduino board.</p>
        <p>Like in the digital input example, the first step is to set the pin mode. In this case we want to set pin 9
          to digital output (DOUT):</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.setDigitalPinMode(9, Pin.DOUT);</code></div>
        <p>The next step is to get a reference to the pin object:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.setDigitalPinMode(9, Pin.DOUT);<br />
  var led = board.getDigitalPin(9);<br />
  </code></div>
        <p>Now since we are using a digital output, there is no need to listen for events. We can simply set the value
          at any time, causing the Led to turn on or off:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">// turn the led on
  led.value = Pin.HIGH;
  
  // turn the led off
  led.value = Pin.LOW;</pre>
        <p>A cool thing you can do with digital output is attach a Generator. A generator is a type of object that can
          automatically change (or drive) an output value by applying various waveforms or other equations. Currently
          the only type of generator in breakout is the <a title="Oscillator"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.generators.Oscillator.html">Oscillator</a> object. The
          oscillator uses a waveform to generate an output signal. The possibilities are much more exciting for an
          analog output (PWM) pin, but you can also use a generator on a digial output to oscillate between 1 and 0 on a
          set frequency. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">var freq = 1.0; // the frequency in seconds
  var times = 0; // the number of times to repeat (zero = forever)
  // create an instance of an Oscillator object that will apply a square wave
  var blink = new Oscillator(Oscillator.SQUARE, freq, 1, 0, 0, times);
  
  // add the Oscillator object to the digital output
  led.addGenerator(blink);
  
  // start the oscillator
  blink.start();</pre>
        <p>This code attaches a square wave oscillator, setting the frequency to 1 second, amplitude to 1, offset and
          phase each to zero, and a repeat count of zero which will cause the oscillator to run &#8216;forever&#8217;.
          Finally the oscillator is started and the Led will blink on for 1 second then off for 1 second repeatedly
          until the program execution ends. You can also call <code>blink.stop()</code> to stop the oscillator.</p>
        <p>You can learn more about Oscillators in the <a href="#analog_output">Analog Output</a> section of this guide
          as well as the examples in Breakout/examples/generators/.</p>
        <p>Also see the <a title="BO.io.LED" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.LED.html">LED</a> object in
          the Breakout/io/ package. It provides a number of helpful methods that make it easier to use an LED. However
          note that some of the methods such as fadeIn, fadeOut and fadeTo can only be used if the LED is connected to a
          PWM pin on the I/O board. You&#8217;ll learn more about using PWM pins in the Analog Output section.</p>
        <p><a name="analog_input"></a></p>
        <h2>Analog Input</h2>
        <p>Setting a pin as an analog input enables you to read data from hundreds (if not thousands) of different
          sensors. For this section let&#8217;s assume a potentiometer is attached to pin A0 of your I/O board and that
          you have created an instance of the IOBoard object named &#8220;board&#8221;.</p>
        <p>Unlike the digital input and output examples, we do not have to set the pin mode to use a pin as an analog
          input, instead we need to enable the analog input pin:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.enableAnalogPin(0);</code></div>
        <p>By default all analog pins are disabled. This is so the I/O board does not have to send analog data
          continuously when it&#8217;s not even needed by the user. Therefore it is necessary to enable analog input for
          the specific pins you are connecting sensors to. It&#8217;s also worth noting that analog data is sent at a
          maximum rate of 19 milliseconds (53 times/second). You can lower the interval (sending data less frequently)
          using the <code>board.setInterval</code> property. So <code>board.setInterval = 33;</code> would cause the
          board to send analog data at a rate of 33 milliseconds (or 30 times/second), but you should not set the
          sampling interval to a rate faster than 19 milliseconds or you could end up with incomplete data.</p>
        <p>The next step is to get a reference to the analog pin:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var sensor = board.getAnalogPin(0);</code></div>
        <p>So to read an analog input we enable the pin then get a reference to the pin object:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.enableAnalogPin(0);<br />
  var sensor = board.getAnalogPin(0);<br />
  </code></div>
        <p>Now that we have enabled analog input and have a reference to the pin we can read the sensor value:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var sensorValue = sensor.value;</code></div>
        <p>Analog input values are in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The value is only updated when it changes. While we can
          read it at any time, it&#8217;s best to add a listener to be notified when the value changes:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>sensor.addEventListener(PinEvent.CHANGE, onSensorUpdate);</code></div>
        <p>The listener function <code>onSensorUpdate</code> will be called automatically each time a new analog input
          value from pin A0 is received. You can use any name you like for the listener function so onPinChange,
          onSensorPinChange, etc are also valid names.</p>
        <p>Next you need to implement the listener:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function onSensorUpdate(event) {
    console.log("sensor value = " + event.target.value);
  }</pre>
        <p>This will print the sensor value to the console each time it changes. Note the <code>event</code> parameter.
          This is a reference to the event object (PinEvent). You can call the paramater anything (evt and e are other
          common names). Every event object has a property called <code>target</code> that provides a reference to the
          object that dispatched (fired) the event. So in this case <code>target</code> refers to the analog input pin.
          Therefore <code>event.target.value</code> refers to the value of the analog input pin that fired the event.
        </p>
        <p>There are a number of useful properties that the pin object provides for analog input. First we will use a
          variable to store the target so we don&#8217;t have to keep referring to it as <code>event.target</code>:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function onSensorUpdate(event) {
    var sensorPin = event.target;
    console.log("sensor value = " + sensorPin.value);
  }</pre>
        <p>Now we can explore some of the pin properties:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function onSensorUpdate(event) {
    var sensorPin = event.target;
    console.log("sensor value = " + sensorPin.value);
  
    // the minimum value sent by the sensor since the application started
    console.log("min value = " + sensorPin.minimum);
  
    // the maximum value sent by the sensor since the application started
    console.log("max value = " + sensorPin.maximum);
  
    // the average of the sensor values since the application started
    console.log("average value = " + sensorPin.average);
  
    // the last (previous) value read
    console.log("previous value = " + sensorPin.lastValue);
  }</pre>
        <p>You may notice if you turn the potentiometer all the way clockwise and then all the way counterclockwise you
          will be quickly left with minimim and maximum values of 0.0 and 1.0 respectively. If at any point you want to
          reset the minimum, maximum and average values you can call the <code>clear()</code> method as follows:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>sensor.clear();</code></div>
        <p>An analog input pin also has a <code>number</code> property, but it may not give you the result you expect.
          For example if you have an Arduino Uno board and you have connected a sensor to pin A0 and you read the
          <code>number</code> property the result will be 14, not 0. This is because the number property is based on a
          count of the total number of analog and digital pins on the I/O board, therefore Analog pin 0 is actually pin
          number 14 on an Arduino Uno. There is another property, <code>analogNumber</code> that returns the analog
          number of the pin so for the Arduino Uno, the analog number of pin A0 will be 0. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">console.log("pin number = " + sensorPin.number); // prints 14 for an Arduino Uno
  
  console.log("analog number = " + sensorPin.analogNumber); // prints 0 for an Uno</pre>
        <p>Breakout also includes a number of filters that you can apply to the analog input data. These include a <a
            title="BO.filters.Convolution"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.filters.Convolution.html">Convolution</a> filter to smooth data,
          a <a title="BO.filters.Scaler" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.filters.Scaler.html">Scaler</a>
          filter to scale from one range of data to another using a variety of equations, and a <a
            title="BO.filters.TriggerPoint"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.filters.TriggerPoint.html">TriggerPoint</a> filter that can be
          used to set a trigger when specific input values are met. To learn more about using filters, see the <a
            title="Using Filters" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/using-filters.html">Using Filters</a> guide and the
          examples in Breakout/examples/filters/.</p>
        <p>If you are using a potentiometer or other linear analog input, it is often easier to use the <a
            title="BO.io.Potentiometer"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.Potentiometer.html">Potentiometer</a> object from the
          Breakout/io/ package rather than using the analog input Pin object directly. The Potentiometer object is a
          wrapper object for the analog input pin providing similar functionality but is a bit easier to use (you
          don&#8217;t have to worry about enabling the analog pin for example, it&#8217;s handled automatically and
          setting filters is also integrated). You will also find this object used in many of the examples. Also, for a
          complex example of using analog inputs as well as creating new IO objects for specific sensors, see the
          implementations of the AnalogAccelerometer and SoftPot objects in Breakout/io/.</p>
        <p><a name="analog_output"></a></p>
        <h2>Analog Output</h2>
        <p>Certain pins on an I/O board can be set as analog output to simulate an analog output signal. I say simulate
          because an actual analog signal is not output, but rather the pin is pulsed on and off rapidly to simulate a
          specific output voltage. This technique is called <a title="PWM defined"
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">Pulse-width modulation</a> (PWM). Most I/O boards
          will have a few PWM pins. The Arduino Uno has 6 PWM pins: digital pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11. On many Arduino
          boards PWM pins are marked with a tilde (~) character. For other I/O boards you may need to refer to the
          datasheet for the board in order to determine which pins are PWM pins, or you can print the pin capabilities
          for your I/O board using the following method:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.reportCapabilities();</code></div>
        <p>Make sure your browser&#8217;s console window (search &#8216;how to view console&#8217; for the browser you
          are using if you are not sure how to show the console) is visible before calling the
          <code>reportCapabilities()</code> method. This will print the modes associated with each pin. If you see a pin
          number with &#8216;mode: pwm&#8217; next to it, then it is PWM capable.</p>
        <p>Now that you have identified the PWM pins on your I/O board, you can use them to control the speed of a motor
          or the intensity of an LED, the color of an RGB Led, generate tones if a speaker is attached, etc. For the
          remainder of this section let&#8217;s assume an LED is connected to a PWM pin on your I/O board and that you
          have created an instance of the IOBoard object and named it &#8220;board&#8221;.</p>
        <p>To use a Pin object as an analog output we first need to set the pin mode to PWM:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>board.setDigitalPinMode(11, Pin.PWM);</code></div>
        <p>Next get a reference to the PWM pin:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var led = board.getDigitalPin(11);</code></div>
        <p>Now we can set the intensity (brightness) of the led:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>// set the LED to 1/4 intensity (where 1.0 is full intensity)<br />
  led.value = 0.25;</code></div>
        <p>Obviously this is more interesting if you can change the value over time. Try creating an on-screen slider to
          change the value between 0.0 and 1.0, or you can use a potentiometer (or other analog input) to change the
          value. Here&#8217;s an example of controlling the LED intensity using a potentiometer connected to analog pin
          0:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">board.setDigitalPinMode(11, Pin.PWM);
  var led = board.getDigitalPin(11);
  
  board.enableAnalogPin(0);
  var pot = board.getAnalogPin(0);
  pot.addEventListener(PinEvent.CHANGE, onPotChange);
  
  function onPotChange(event) {
    var pin = event.target;
    // set the LED value equal to the potentiometer value
    led.value = pin.value;
  }</pre>
        <p>You can also attach an <a title="BO.filters.Oscillator"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.generators.Oscillator.html">Oscillator</a> to an analog output
          to drive the output value with a waveform. We looked at the Oscillator (which is a type of Generator) briefly
          in the <a title="digital output" href="#digital_output">Digital
            Output</a> section where we used it to turn an LED on and off. When an LED is connected to a PWM pin,
          however you can apply a variety of waveforms to the output value. Here&#8217;s an example of fading an LED on
          and off using a sine wave:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">var freq = 2.0; // time in seconds
  var amplitude = 1.0;
  var offset = 0;
  var phase = 0;
  var repeat = 0; // where zero = forever, and 10 = repeat 10 times
  // create a new sine wave oscillator
  // this will fade the LED on over a 2 second period and then off over a 2 second
  // period and repeat this cycle until the oscillator is stopped or the program
  // execution ends
  var sinewave = new Oscillator(Oscillator.SIN, freq, amplitude, offset, phase, repeat);
  
  // add the oscillator to the PWM pin
  led.addGenerator(sinewave);
  
  // start the oscillator
  sinewave.start();</pre>
        <p>Some additional types of waveforms you can apply are: SAW, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, LINEAR, and IMPULSE. To learn
          more about using Generators, see the examples in Breakout/examples/generators/.</p>
        <p>The Breakout/io/ package includes a number of useful objects (&#8216;classes&#8217;) such as <a
            title="BO.io.LED" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.LED.html">LED</a>, <a title="BO.io.RGBLED"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.RGBLED.html">RGBLED</a>, <a title="BO.io.Servo"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.Servo.html">Servo</a>, and <a title="BO.io.DCMotor"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/symbols/BO.io.DCMotor.html">DCMotor</a> that are based on the analog output
          pin. It&#8217;s often easier to use these hardware abstractions rather than the analog Pin object directly.
          See Breakout/examples/actuators/ for examples. Also take a look at the code for these objects for an example
          of how to create new IO objects from Pin objects.</p>
