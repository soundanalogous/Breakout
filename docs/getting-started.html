        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <small class="post-meta"></small>
        <p>To get started, you&#8217;ll need to download the Breakout software, make sure you have the Arduino
          application installed and a <a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/compatible-boards.html">compatible I/O board</a> along
          with a button, LED, a couple of resistors and a <a title="breadboard"
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard">breadboard</a>.</p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p><a title="Requirements" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/requirements.html">View system and browser requirements</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Download and Install Breakout</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Clone the <a title="breakout github"
              href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout" target="_blank">github</a> repository or <a title="download breakout" href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout/releases" target="_blank">download the latest release</a></li>
          <li>See the <a title="installation" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/using-breakout-server.html#installation">Installation</a>
            section of the Using Breakout Server guide.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Upload BreakoutFirmata to your I/O board</h2>
        <p>This section assumes you are familiar with the Arduino application and the process of uploading new programs
          (&#8216;sketches&#8217;) to the I/O board. If you are new to Arduino, please first see the Getting Started
          section for your platform (Mac, Windows or Linux) on the <a title="Arduino"
            href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage">Arduino</a> website.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Install the <a href="https://github.com/firmata/ConfigurableFirmata">ConfigurableFirmata</a> library in
            you Arduino sketchbook libraries folder. The easiest way to install it if you are using Arduino version
            1.6.4 or higher is to use the Arduino Library manager (in the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch &gt; Include
            Library &gt; Manage Libraries, then search for &#8220;ConfigurableFirmata&#8221; and click on Install after
            tapping on the ConfigurableFirmata item in the filtered results. If you have an older Arduino IDE, see the
            installation instructions in the ConfigurableFirmata <a
              href="https://github.com/firmata/ConfigurableFirmata#installation">README</a> file.</li>
          <li>Navigate to Breakout/firmware/BreakoutFirmata/.</li>
          <li>Open BreakoutFirmata.ino in <a title="Arduino" href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino 1.0</a>
            or higher (Preferably Arduino version 1.6.4 or higher).</li>
          <li>Compile and upload BreakoutFirmata to your I/O board (make sure your particular I/O board is selected
            under Tools -&gt; Board).</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>BreakoutFirmata is a program that allows a client application running on a computer to communicate with
            the I/O board, and is just one application of the Firmata protocol. See <a title="firmata.org"
              href="http://firmata.org">firmata.org</a> for a complete overview.</em></p>
        <h2>Wire a button and LED to your I/O board</h2>
        <p>Open <a title="Breakout/examples/schematics"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/examples/schematics.pdf">schematics.pdf</a> and wire up your components
          according to wiring diagram on page 2. If you have no idea what the diagram means, read through the lessons in
          this <a title="excellent tutorial by ladyada" href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html">tutorial
            by ladyada.</a>.</p>
        <h2>Run Breakout Server</h2>
        <p>Assuming you performed the steps in the Download and Install Breakout section above, you can now double-click
          on the Breakout Server application (you&#8217;ll find it in Breakout/server/) for your platform to launch it
          (Linux users need to launch the jar file from the command line unless you set up a custom launcher).</p>
        <h4>When you launch the server you should see the following:</h4>
        <h2><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/status_panel.png"><img decoding="async"
              class="alignleft size-full wp-image-140" title="status_panel"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/status_panel.png" alt="status panel" width="480"
              height="360" /></a></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the serial port your I/O board is connected to (if it is not already displayed in the drop down).
          </li>
          <li>If you have a firewall enabled for your computer or network, make sure port 8887 is open, or enter a new
            port number that is open (be sure to hit the enter key upon typing in a new port number).</li>
          <li>Click the Connect button.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>You should now see this screen:</h4>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/start_single.png"><img decoding="async"
              loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-142" title="start_single"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/start_single.png" alt="connection" width="480"
              height="360" /></a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The name of your computer and the network port you are connected to should be printed along with the serial
          port your I/O board is connected to (on windows this will say something like &#8220;COM3&#8221;).</p>
        <p>If you encounter any issues, refer to the <a title="troubleshooting"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/using-breakout-server.html#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> section of the Using Breakout
          Server guide.</p>

        <h2>Running the Hello World example</h2>
        <p>Assuming you were able to launch the server and connect without any issues, you should now be ready to open
          an example.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Chrome, Firefox or Safari and enter the following url:
            http://localhost:8887/examples/getting_started/hello_world.html</li>
          <li>You should be able to click the LED On an LED Off buttons to turn the LED wired to pin 11 on or off. If
            you press the button wired to pin 2 of the Arduino board, the button state (pressed or released) should be
            displayed on the screen.</li>
          <li>If this is not working, double (or triple) check your wiring. You may have the Led backwards for example.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Note that if you changed the network port in the server you will also need to change the network port in
            the url above as well as in the hello_world.html file on line 71.</em></p>
        <h2>Running the Hello World example from the Web</h2>
        <p>You can also load files from external web servers (such as the one hosting this post). In this case Breakout
          Server is simply bridging the serial data from the I/O board with the websocket connection to the page you
          have loaded from an external server. Note that the example below will only work if you can connect to network
          port 8887 (because this is the port number set in the file you are loading).</p>
        <ol>
          <li>With Breakout Server connected, refresh this page. Use the buttons to turn the LED on or off. Pressing the
            physical button on the breadboard will display the button state (pressed or released) on the screen below.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/examples/getting_started/hello_world.html" width="650"
            height="440"></iframe></p>

        <h2>Let&#8217;s take a look at the hello_world code</h2>
        <p>The minified file Breakout.js is included near the top of the file. You&#8217;ll see jQuery is also included
          on the following line. Many of the examples use the jQuery library. jQuery is not a requirement of Breakout
          and is only included for the examples. You can use any javascript framework you like with Breakout.</p>
        <p>Breakout uses the namespace BO. If you do not want to type the full namespace for each object, you can
          declare variables at the top of your file to refer to the objects from the Breakout library that you are
          using. Here are the objects used in the hello_world example:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var IOBoard = BO.IOBoard;<br />
  var IOBoardEvent = BO.IOBoardEvent;<br />
  var LED = BO.io.LED;<br />
  var Button = BO.io.Button;<br />
  var ButtonEvent = BO.io.ButtonEvent;</code></div>
        <p>See the Breakout <a title="docs" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/index.html">docs</a> for details on all of the
          Breakout objects.</p>
        <p>Next an instance of the <a title="IOBoard"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/classes/BO.IOBoard.html">IOBoard</a> object is created. The constructor
          parameters are the IP address (as a String), and the network port.</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>var arduino = new IOBoard(host, 8887);</code></div>
        <p>Host is the IP address or hostname of the computer the IO board is connected to. The host is set to either
          &#8220;localhost&#8221; or window.location.hostname (which is the IP address of the computer serving this web
          page). Just in case the following lines don&#8217;t make sense, I&#8217;ll explain them briefly:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">var host = window.location.hostname;
  // if the file is opened locally, set the host to "localhost"
  if (window.location.protocol.indexOf("file:") === 0) {
    host = "localhost";
  }</pre>
        <p>What this does is sets the host by default to window.location.hostname, but if the file is opened directly
          (double-clicking on the html file) instead of loading it from a server, the host is set to
          &#8220;localhost&#8221;. This enables the file to be opened by either means. However you can leave these lines
          out in your own applications and simple set the host to &#8220;localhost&#8221;,
          <code>window.location.hostname</code>, or a specific IP address. Setting host to
          <code>window.location.hostname</code> enables you to open the application locally or on a mobile device on the
          same network as the computer the IO board is connected to.</p>
        <p>When an IOBoard instance is created it must finish its initialization routine before you can send any
          commands. Listen for the READY event to be notified when it is safe to send data to the I/O board.</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>arduino.addEventListener(IOBoardEvent.READY, onReady);</code></div>
        <p>When the onReady method is called, the first thing you should always do is remove the event listener for the
          READY event:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>arduino.removeEventListener(IOBoardEvent.READY, onReady);</code></div>
        <p>Next an instance of an <a title="LED" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/classes/BO.io.LED.html">LED</a> object
          is created. Breakout provides a number of hardware abstractions such as LED, Button, Servo, etc. The LED
          constructor parameters are a reference to the IOBoard object, and a reference to the pin the LED is connected
          to. The getDigitalPin(pinNumber) and getAnalogPin(analogPinNumber) methods are used to get a reference to a
          Pin object. See the docs for <a title="BO.Pin"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/classes/BO.Pin.html">BO.Pin</a> for details.</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>led = new LED(arduino, arduino.getDigitalPin(11));</code></div>
        <p>Next an instance of the <a title="Button"
            href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/api-docs/classes/BO.io.Button.html">Button</a> object is created. Note that if you
          are using a javascript UI library that also has an object named &#8216;Button&#8217; then you will need to use
          the full namespace for the Breakout button to avoid any naming conflicts (BO.io.Button). The Button object
          takes 3 parameters: A reference to the IOBoard, a reference to the Pin the button is attached to, and the
          button mode. The default mode is Button.PULL_DOWN. Other modes are Button.PULL_UP and Button.INTERNAL_PULL_UP.
          Which one you use depends on how you have wired the physical button to your I/O board. If the other end of the
          resistor connected to the button is connected to ground, then the mode is PULL_DOWN, if the other end is
          connected to power, then the mode is PULL_UP and if a resistor is not used, the mode is INTERNAL_PULL_UP.</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper">
          <code>var button = new Button(arduino, arduino.getDigitalPin(2), Button.PULL_DOWN);</code></div>
        <p>Listen for PRESS and RELEASE button events to be notified when the button state changes.</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>button.addEventListener(ButtonEvent.PRESS, onPress);<br />
  button.addEventListener(ButtonEvent.RELEASE, onRelease);</code></div>
        <p>The onPress method is called whenever the physical button is pressed and the onRelease method is called every
          time the button is released. The parameter passed to onPress and onRelease callback functions is a reference
          to the event object. Each event object has a target property which refers to the object that triggered the
          event. Therefore event.target gives us a reference to the button that was pressed (in the case that more than
          one button is connected to the I/O board, this is helpful). jQuery is used simply to print the button state to
          the browser window.</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function onPress(evt) {
    // get a reference to the button object that fired the event
    var btn = evt.target;
    $('#state').html("Button " + btn.pinNumber + " state: Pressed");
  }
  
  function onRelease(evt) {
    // get a reference to the button object that fired the event
    var btn = evt.target;
    $('#state').html("Button " + btn.pinNumber + " state: Released");
  }</pre>
        <p>The following 2 lines register click events with the two on-screen buttons:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">$('#btnLeft').on('click', turnLedOff);
  $('#btnRight').on('click', turnLedOn);</pre>
        <p>When a button is clicked, the LED is turned on or off:</p>
        <pre class="code_wrapper">function turnLedOn(evt) {
    // turn the LED on
    led.on();
  }
  
  function turnLedOff(evt) {
    // turn the LED off
    led.off();
  }</pre>
        <p>The remaining code is simply used to show or hide the schematic view.</p>
