        <h2>Breakout release file overview</h2>
        <p>This section provides and overview of the Breakout file structure. If you downloaded the Breakout release
          from this website, then you should have the following file structure:</p>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/release_dir.png"><img decoding="async"
              class="alignleft size-full wp-image-299" title="release_dir"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/release_dir.png" alt="release directory" width="323"
              height="245" /></a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The following sections describe the directory contents:</p>
        <h3>ChangeLog</h3>
        <p>A log of the changes in each release.</p>
        <h3>custom_examples</h3>
        <p>This folder contains a few examples that demonstrate how to use Breakout without StandardFirmata. The schematics.pdf file contains wiring diagrams for the examples.
          Any libraries required to run the example files are included in the libs subdirectory.</p>
        <h3>dist</h3>
        <p>The dist directory contains the minified Breakout files. You will need to include one of these files in your
          applications. There are 3 versions described below:</p>
        <h5>Breakout.js</h5>
        <p>This is the minified version the full Breakout javascript library. Everything in Breakout/src/ except the
          files in Breakout/src/custom/ is included.</p>
        <h5>Breakout-base.js</h5>
        <p>This minified file contains everything in Breakout/src/ except the files in Breakout/io/. Use this version if
          you are not using any of the IO objects (from Breakout/io/) or would only like to include the IO objects you
          are using in your application. In the later case, you must include the IO objects individually after including
          the Breakout-base.js file. Also, if an IO object has a corresponding Event object, the Event object must be
          included before the IO object. For example if the only IO object you are using is an analog accelerometer, you
          could include the following rather than the full Breakout.js file which would include all IO objects:</p>
        <div class="code_wrapper"><code>&lt;script src="../dist/Breakout-base.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
  &lt;script src="../src/AccelerometerEvent.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
  &lt;script src="../src/AnalogAccelerometer.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></div>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Breakout-core.js</h5>
        <p>This file contains only the minimal objects required to communicate with the I/O board. The only use for this
          version is in creating applications that don&#8217;t rely on StandardFirmata. See the
          Breakout/custom_examples/rfid_example2.html. Currently this file contains more than you need for custom
          applications. A lighter file will be created in the future for this type of application.</p>
        <h3>docs</h3>
        <p>This folder contains the documentation of the objects in the Breakout javascript library. Launch index.html
          to view the documentation. You can also view it online from the Docs link.</p>
        <h3>examples</h3>
        <p>Examples are created for many of the objects in the Breakout library. See the various subdirectories for
          examples to use certain types of components such as actuators or sensors. There are also examples for using
          Breakout with other javascript frameworks such as <a title="three.js"
            href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</a> and <a title="processing.js"
            href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>. The schematic.pdf file contains wiring diagrams for all
          of the example files. The libs subdirectory contains any libraries required by the examples.</p>
        <h3>firmware</h3>
        <p>The firmware folder contains the AdvancedFirmata arduino sketch. You must upload AdvancedFirmata to your
          board before using Breakout. Open the AdvancedFirmata.ino file in the Arudino IDE (version 1.0 or higher),
          select your board from Tools -&gt; Board, compile and upload.</p>
        <h3>LICENSE</h3>
        <p>This file contains the text of the MIT license that applies to Breakout.</p>
        <h3>node_server</h3>
        <p>A <a href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/breakout-server">node.js-based version of Breakout Server</a>
          used to be included with Breakout. However not it resides in its own github repository. See the instructions
          in the <a href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/breakout-server/blob/master/README.md">README</a> file to
          get started if you want to use this server. Note however that it is more difficult to use than the simple GUI
          version of Breakout Server.</p>
        <h3>README.md</h3>
        <p>This file provides an overview of the Breakout project. It is also what you see when you view the Breakout
          project on <a title="breakout on github" href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout"
            target="_blank">github</a>.</p>
        <h3>server</h3>
        <p>If you downloaded the Breakout beta release package, the contents of the server directory should be as
          follows:</p>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/server_release.png"><img decoding="async"
              loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-338" title="server_release"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/server_release.png" alt="server release" width="302"
              height="111" /></a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>If you see more files than above such as a build and lib folder etc, then you cloned or downloaded the
            full Breakout repository rather than the distribution release. That&#8217;s okay, just refer the server
            section of <a title="repository structure" href="#breakout_repository_structure">Breakout Repository file
              structure overview</a> below.</em></p>
        <p>The release version of the server directory contains a compressed version of each server. You will need to
          expand the Server for your platform (see the<a title="installing breakout"
            href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout/using-breakout-server.html#installation" target="_blank"> Installation</a> section of the
          Using Breakout Server guide for details). You can also delete the files for the other platforms. In order to
          simplify the downloadable Breakout distribution, the download does not include the server source code. You
          must clone the Breakout source code on Github to get the Breakout Server source.</p>
        <h3>src</h3>
        <p>The src directory contains all of the javascript source files for Breakout.</p>
        <h5>core</h5>
        <p>The core files are the base of the Breakout framework.</p>
        <h5>custom</h5>
        <p>The custom directory contains files for objects that do not use StandardFirmata, but are useful enough to be
          included in the distribution source code. The files in the custom directory are not included in the minified
          Breakout.js file. See Breakout/custom_exemples/ for examples of use.</p>
        <h5>filters</h5>
        <p>This directory contains a number of objects that are used to filter analog input. See the examples in
          Breakout/examples/filters/ and the <a title="using filters" href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/using-filters.html"
            target="_blank">Using Filters</a> guide for details.</p>
        <h5>generators</h5>
        <p>This directory contains an oscillator object that can generate signals on an output pin. For example it can
          be used to blink or fade an LED. See the examples in Breakout/examples/generators/.</p>
        <h5>io</h5>
        <p>The files/objects in the io directory are hardware abstractions of physical components. These objects greatly
          simplify the ability to interface with various input (sensors) and output (actuators). Expect additional io
          objects to be added in the future. See the examples in Breakout/examples/actuators/ and
          Breakout/examples/sensors/. Also see the examples in Breakout/examples/processing_js/ and
          Breakout/examples/three_js/ for applications of using sensors with WebGL graphics.</p>
        <h5>utils</h5>
        <p>The utils folder contains javascript files that are used in Breakout but are not specific to Breakout. These
          provide common utilities such as event handling, timers, namespacing, etc.</p>

        <h2>Breakout repository file structure overview</h2>
        <p>If you cloned the repository from github then you&#8217;ll have some additional folders and files:</p>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/clone_dir.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"
              class="alignleft size-full wp-image-331" title="clone_dir"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/clone_dir.png" alt="clone dir" width="302"

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>server</h3>
        <p>The biggest difference between the repository and the release build is the structure of the Breakout/server/
          directory. By cloning the repository you have access to the Breakout Server source code. In the repositoy the
          server directory contains the following files:</p>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/clone_server_release.png"><img decoding="async"
              loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-316" title="server_release"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/clone_server_release.png" alt="server release"
              width="302" height="225" /></a></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first 4 items are versions of the server for Mac, Win and Linux.</li>
          <li>The build subdirectory contains the Jar file. You can run Breakout Server from this jar file or if
            you&#8217;re using Mac OS X or Windows you can use the more convenient executables found in the respective
            platform folders above.</li>
          <li>An eclipse_archive is included as a convenience for any eclipse users who would like to modify the source
            code.</li>
          <li>The lib subdirectory contains the jar files required to build the server.</li>
          <li>README.md explains how to build Breakout Server. The build step is only required if you modify Breakout
            Server. Pre-built versions are already included for Mac, Win, and Linux.</li>
          <li>The release subdirectory contains graphics and other files used to build the executables.</li>
          <li>src contains the java source files and the manifest file.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The repository also includes the following files and folders that are not present in the release
          distribution:</p>
        <h3>build</h3>
        <p>This folder contains the Closure Compiler that is used to minify the Breakout javascript code. There are
          several build files that can be run to minify the Breakout code. See the README file for build instructions.
