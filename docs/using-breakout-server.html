        <h1>Using Breakout Server</h1>
        <small class="post-meta"></small>
        <p>Breakout Server is simple WebSocket and HTTP server that bridges an I/O board (such as Arduino) to a web
          browser. The server uses <a title="webbit" href="https://github.com/webbit/webbit">webbit</a> for the
          WebSocket and HTTP server connections. If you prefer, you can serve your pages from another web server (for
          example if you need to use php) and simply use Breakout Server to connect to the I/O board via WebSockets.</p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p><a title="Requirements" href="http://breakoutjs.com/requirements/">View system and browser
            requirements</a><br />
          <a name="installation"></a>
        </p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>To install Breakout Server, simply download the files to your hard drive. You&#8217;ll find a version of
          Breakout Server for your platform in Breakout/server/. If you cloned or downloaded the repository from github,
          then this directory will contain folders for Mac OS X, Windows (32 bit and 64 bit) and Linux along with the
          server source code. If you downloaded the Breakout zip package from the Download link, you will find a zip for
          each platform in the Breakout/server/ directory. Note that if you move the server files out of the
          Breakout/server/ directory, you will need to update the webserver root directory location. See <a
            title="webserver_root" href="#webserver_root">WebServer Root Directory</a> in the Settings Panel section of
          this guide for more info.</p>
        <p>Here are more specific instructions for each platform:</p>
        <h5>Mac OS X</h5>
        <p>If you downloaded the Breakout release package, expand the breakout_server-mac.zip file in Breakout/server/.
          You can either run the Breakout Server application directly from the breakout_server-mac folder or move it to
          your Applications directory. You can delete the win and linux zip files.</p>
        <p>If you cloned the source from github then the contents of the Breakout/server/ directory are not compressed.
          You can use the server for your platform as is, or you can copy it to Applications or another location on your
          hard drive.</p>
        <p>Mac OS X Mountain Lion (and newer) users may need to <a
            href="https://answers.uchicago.edu/page.php?id=25481">temporarily disable Gatekeeper</a> to launch Breakout
          Server for the first time. After the initial launch you can re-enable Gatekeeper.</p>
        <h5>Windows</h5>
        <p>If you downloaded the Breakout release package, expand the breakout_server-win.zip (32 or 64 bit version
          depending on your OS) file found in the Breakout/server/ directory. You can either move the
          breakout-server-win folder to another location on your hard drive or run it directly from the
          breakout_server-win folder. You can delete the mac and linux zip files.</p>
        <p>If you cloned the source from github then the contents of the Breakout/server/ directory are not compressed.
          You can use the server for your platform as is, or you can copy it to another location on your hard drive. If
          you want to move the Breakout Server.exe application, move the breakout_server-win folder. The rxtxServer.dll
          must be at the same level as the exe file in order for the server to work properly.</p>
        <h5>Linux</h5>
        <p>Breakout Server has only been tested in 64-bit Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04 and 14.04 and it may or may not work on
          other distributions. You will first need to run <code>sudo apt-get install librxtx-java</code> to ensure that
          the serial drivers are properly installed. If you know how to manually install them, you may do that as well.
          Once the serial drivers are installed you can launch the jar from the command line (java -jar
          BreakoutServer.jar).</p>
        <p>If you downloaded the Breakout release package, expand the breakout_server-linux.zip file found in the
          Breakout/server/ directory. You can move the breakout-server-linux folder to another location on your hard
          drive or run the JAR directly from the breakout_server-linux folder. You can delete the mac and win zip files.
          The librxtxSerial.so driver is included in case you choose to manually install this file, however it should
          have been installed to the proper location automatically if you ran
          <code>sudo apt-get install librxtx-java</code>. The Breakout icon is also included in case you want to create
          a custom launcher for the Breakout Server application.<br />
          <a name="status_panel"></a>
        </p>
        <h2>Application Overview: Status Panel</h2>
        <p>The status panel provides the following UI elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A drop-down list to select the serial port the I/O Board is connected to (most often the 1st item in the
            list so you don&#8217;t have to select it).</li>
          <li>A text input containing the network port (default = 8887). You can also change this value (see
            &#8216;Changing the Network Port&#8217; below)</li>
          <li>A button to connect/disconnect the server (connects/disconnects the serial port and the web server).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4></h4>
        <p><a name="change_port"></a></p>
        <h5>Changing the network port</h5>
        <p>You can change the network port number by entering a new number. Be sure to press the Enter key upon changing
          the number. The new number will be stored until it is changed again in the future. When you change the port
          number, be sure to use the new port number when creating a new instance of the I/O board in your script. For
          example, if you changed the port number to 9000 in the Status panel you need to use the new port number when
          creating an new instance of an IOBoard object:</p>
        <p><code>var arduino = new IOBoard("localhost", 9000);</code><br />
          <a name="settings_panel"></a>
        </p>
        <h2>Application Overview: Settings Panel</h2>
        <p>The settings panel provides the following UI elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A non-editable textbox displaying the web server root directory</li>
          <li>A button to open a file chooser to select a new root directory for the web server</li>
          <li>A checkbox to enable multi-client connections (see the section on multi-client connections below)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a name="webserver_root"></a><br />
          <a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/settings_panel.png"><img decoding="async"
              loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-141" title="settings_panel"
              src="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/settings_panel.png" alt="settings panel" width="480"
              height="360" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Webserver Root Directory</h5>
        <p>The default webserver root directory is &#8220;../../&#8221; which is the relative path from the server (ie
          server/breakout_server-mac) to the root of the Breakout directory. If you move Breakout Server to another
          directory (such as your Applications folder) you can update the Webserver root directory by clicking the
          Choose New Webserver Root button and selecting the root directory of your web app(s). This may be the Breakout
          directory, or any directory you choose to work from (as long as you also copy the Breakout.js file and any
          other required files to that directory). The new webserver root will be stored until you change it again in
          the future.</p>
        <h5>Multi-client Connections</h5>
        <p>By default Breakout Server only supports one client connection at a time. While one browser is connected, if
          another browser tries to connect, the connection is taken over by the 2nd browser. This is because in default
          mode, upon connect, a soft reset of the I/O board is performed to set the pins back to their default state.
          This is helpful when you are writing a script and want new code to execute when you refresh the browser. If
          the I/O board pins did not reset to their default state, the script would begin executing with the board in
          the state it was in prior to refreshing the browser.</p>
        <p>However, there are other cases in which you may want to share data from the I/O board with multiple clients.
          In this case you expect to connect to a I/O board in its current state. Enabling the multi-client connections
          checkbox will allow multiple clients to connect to the server. Upon connection, the current state of the I/O
          board is copied to the client so there are no interruptions of data being viewed on other clients.</p>
        <p>If you only need a single client connection but do not want the I/O board to reset it&#8217;s state upon
          refreshing the browser, then you can also enable multi-client connection mode for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Also, it&#8217;s worth noting that multi-connect mode works well when you are sending data from the IOBoard
          (such as sensor data), but not as well when you are sending data to the IOBoard (such as controlling a motor
          or an RGB led) unless each client is trying to control a unique component on the IOBoard.</p>
        <h2>Connecting</h2>
        <p>Clicking the &#8216;Connect&#8217; button creates the serial connection to the I/O board and also starts the
          WebSocket and HTTP server. Upon connection you should see the following in the status message area:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name and port of the computer you are connected to.</li>
          <li>The Serial port you are connected to.</li>
          <li>The Connect button should now read &#8220;Disconnect&#8221;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/start_single.png"><img decoding="async"

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Note that when you click the Connect button that the IOBoard is reset. This is helpful if you are in
            multi-client mode and want to reset the IOBoard to it&#8217;s default state. All clients will be
            disconnected when the Disconnect button is clicked.</em></p>
        <p>If you enabled multi-client connection mode in the Settings Pane, then you should see the following:</p>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/start_multi_client.png"><img decoding="async"

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To connect a client, open web browser and enter the url of an html file (be sure to include the port number
          in the url&#8230; for example: http://localhost:8887/examples/getting_started/hello_world.html). You should
          see the connection status as follows:</p>
        <p><a href="http://soundanalogous.github.io/Breakout/images/client_connected.png"><img decoding="async"
              loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-146" title="client_connected"

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In multi-client connection mode you will see the number of active connections. Note that the client number
          may be higher than the number of active connections, especially if you are refreshing one of the open browser
          windows.</p>

        <h2>Connecting Mobile Devices</h2>
        <p>Mobile browser clients can connect to Breakout Server if they support WebSockets. Currently iOS, Firefox (8
          or higher) for Android and Chrome Beta for Android (ice cream sandwich only) support WebSockets. Performance
          depends on the complexity of the web app you are trying to load. To connect a mobile device, you must be on
          the same network as the computer running Breakout Server and you must set the IP address in the IOBoard
          constructor to the IP address of the computer running the server. For example if the IP address of the
          computer running Breakout Server is 192.168.1.20 then instantiate an IOBoard as follows and you should be able
          to load the page on a mobile device:</p>
        <p><code>var arduino = new IOBoard("192.168.1.20", 8887);</code><br />
          <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
        </p>
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If you run into any issues while trying to use Breakout Server, first check the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure your firewall allows port 8887 (or any new port number you may have set).</li>
          <li>Make sure your I/O board serial port is available. Verify by compiling and uploading a sketch in the
            Arduino IDE.</li>
          <li>Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 or higher installed.</li>
          <li>If you moved Breakout Server out of the Breakout/server/ directory, make sure you updated the WebServer
            Root Directory location in the Settings panel.</li>
          <li>If you are attempting to connect from a mobile device, make sure the device browser supports WebSockets
            and that you are on the same network as the computer running Breakout Server. Also make sure you are using a
            fairly new device (for example iPhone 3G and older are too slow).</li>
          <li>If the issue persists, file an issue on the <a title="Breakout github site"
              href="https://github.com/soundanalogous/Breakout">Breakout github site</a>.</li>
